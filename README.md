## Quick Start

Bulla is designed to be easily self-hosted. Just a single Docker container with SQLite. PostgreSQL and imgproxy are optional.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8080 \
  -v bulla_data:/app/database \
  -e APP_URL=https://comments.example.com \
  ghcr.io/angristan/bulla:latest
```

To add comments to your site:

```html
<script
    src="https://comments.example.com/embed/embed.js"
    data-bulla="https://comments.example.com"
    async
></script>
<div id="bulla-thread"></div>
```

```

- **Embed Widget** (`embed/`) - Lightweight Preact app (~10KB) injected into user sites via script tag. Communicates with the backend via REST API.
- **Admin Panel** (`resources/js/`) - React SPA using Inertia.js for server-driven routing. Manages comments, settings, and moderation.
- **Backend** (`app/`) - Laravel API handling comments, authentication, notifications, and storage.

## Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/angristan/bulla
cd bulla

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate

# Start development (installs deps, runs server + vite + embed watcher)
composer run dev
```

This runs concurrently:

- Laravel server (`php artisan serve`)
- Queue worker (`php artisan queue:listen`)
- Log viewer (`php artisan pail`)
- Vite for admin assets (`npm run dev`)
- Embed widget watcher (`npm run dev --prefix embed`)

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test tests/Feature/Comment

# With coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

Tests run against both SQLite and PostgreSQL in CI.

## Features

### Importing Comments

Bulla supports importing from:

- **isso** - Upload your isso SQLite database file
- **Disqus** - Export your data from Disqus and upload the XML file
- **WordPress** - Export comments via WXR (WordPress eXtended RSS) format

To import: Go to Admin > Settings > Import, select your platform, and upload the file. Comments will be imported with original timestamps preserved.

After importing, use the "Claim Admin Comments" feature in Settings to mark your past comments as admin by matching email or author name.

### Telegram bot

One of my favorite features is the Telegram bot integration. It allows you to receive notifications for new comments and replies directly in Telegram. You can also moderate comments (approve, delete, mark as spam) and reply to comments right from the chat. It's very conveniant for staying on top of discussions on the go!

All configuration is done through the admin panel after initial setup. Key settings:

- **Moderation mode:** None or all comments
