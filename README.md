## Quick Start

Bulla is designed to be easily self-hosted. Just a single Docker container with SQLite. PostgreSQL and imgproxy are optional.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v bulla_data:/app/database \
  -v bulla_storage:/app/storage \
  -e APP_URL=https://comments.example.com \
  ghcr.io/angristan/bulla:latest
```

To add comments to your site:

```html
<script
    src="https://comments.example.com/embed/embed.js"
    data-bulla="https://comments.example.com"
    async
></script>
<div id="bulla-thread"></div>
```

## Documentation

- [API Reference](docs/api.md)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel 12, PHP 8.3+
- **Admin Panel:** React, Inertia.js, Mantine
- **Embed Widget:** Preact, CSS
- **Database:** SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Docker with FrankenPHP

## Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/angristan/bulla
cd bulla

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate

# Start development (installs deps, runs server + vite + embed watcher)
composer run dev
```

This runs concurrently:
- Laravel server (`php artisan serve`)
- Queue worker (`php artisan queue:listen`)
- Log viewer (`php artisan pail`)
- Vite for admin assets (`npm run dev`)
- Embed widget watcher (`npm run dev --prefix embed`)

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test tests/Feature/Comment

# With coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

Tests run against both SQLite and PostgreSQL in CI.
